## What is this folder?

To prevent conflicts during research,
this folder holds the individual notebooks
for each person in the project. This folder
has symbolic links to the root source
folders. The data/ folder in this folder
is the same as the data/ folder in the main
folder. This allows us to copy code from
our individual notebooks into the index/main
notebook without changing code or having
multiple copies of the same information in
two different places.
